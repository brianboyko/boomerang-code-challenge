Code Challenge for Boomerang:

Hey Brian,

Instructions (paraphrased):

Take code provided, which will highlight a randomly chosen message when pasted in the console.

Modify the code to randomly highlight three messages instead.

Please also include a description of some test cases that you would want to verify your solution against before shipping it to customers.

The solution should be robust, but don't worry about writing unit tests or making sure it has optimal runtime characteristics.
